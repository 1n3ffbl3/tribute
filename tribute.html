        <p class="text-center">On her website we can read that she was born in October 1962 and grew up in Washington, DC, moving to England after
          graduating with a BA in English from Oberlin College (Ohio). For several years she worked as a reference book editor,
          while writing short stories in my spare time. In 1993 she quit to do an MA in Creative Writing from the University
          of East Anglia (Norwich, England). Afterwards she juggled freelance editing with writing until eventually she was
          able to write full-time.</p>

            surprises me. I am in this world, at my desk or kitchen table, but I am simultaneously holding in my head another
            world full of people I have never physically met but know to their core. That world and those people pour out
            through my pen: rough – often very rough – but insistent."
